#1).

setImmediate is faster than setTimeout, this is because that 

setTimeout is calling the function after delay has finished. Whenever a function is called it is not executed 
immediately, but it is queued to the callback queue so that it is executed after all the executing and currently 
queued eventhandlers finish first. But, setImmediate checks queue of I/O eventhandlers. If all I/O events in the 
current snapshot are processed, it executes the callback. It queues them immedieately after the last I/O handler.
So it is faster.

#2)

setImmediate queue the function behind all I/O event callbacks that are already in the event queue. 

process.nextTick queue the function at the head of the event queue, and it executes immediately after the current 
function completes.
